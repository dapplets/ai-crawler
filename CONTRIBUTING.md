Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! If you want any guidance whatsoever with contributing, don't hesitate to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YcxbkcyjMV)!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [Readme](README.md) and [Documentation](https://docs.dapplets.org).

## Getting started

To get started you need to have [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) installed on your machine and in your path.
You also need to fork and clone the repository and download all dependencies:

```bash
npm i --force
```

### Get it running

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a Webpack that will update whenever code is changed.

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check and fix [the coding style](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

you can open a new issue.
